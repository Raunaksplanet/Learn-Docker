STEPS
Create a Dockerfile
Add instructions in Dockerfile to create Docker image
Run Dockerfile to create Docker image
Run Docker image to create Docker container
Access the application running in Docker container

Dockerfile ＞ Docker Image ＞ Docker Container ＞ Access the App

Step 1 - Create a new directory mkdir myapp
       cd myapp   

Step 2 - Create a file called "index.html" echo "Hello, world!" ＞ index.html

Step 3 - Create a file named Dockerfile  touch Dockerfile

Step 4 - Open the "Dockerfile" file in a text editor and add the following lines:

FROM nginx
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html

This Dockerfile defines a new Docker image that 
- uses the official nginx image as a base
- then copy the index.html file to the appropriate location in the image

A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions to build a Docker Image
When we run a Dockerfile, Docker image is created
When we run the docker image, containers are created

Step 5 - Start docker & Build docker image from dockerfile 
docker build -t myapp .
This command builds a new Docker image with the tag "myapp" using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

Step 6 - Run docker container from the image   
docker run -p 8080:80 myapp
This tells Docker to run the myapp container and map port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 inside the container

Step 7 - Access the app
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the "Hello, world!" message displayed in your web browser.
